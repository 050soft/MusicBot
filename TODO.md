# TODO List for MusicBot
Below is a list of things that are yet to be done    
Might make this into a trello page

## TODO
- [ ] Privacy configuration 
  - [ ] Make /playing privacy toggeable
    - [ ] Add the command to toggle
    - [ ] Make the command respect the value set
  - [ ] Make history privacy toggeable
      - [ ] Add the command to toggle
      - [ ] Make the commands respect the value set
- [ ] Add structure to lastfm handling, AuthManager.ts handles stuff that isn't directly auth related.

## In progress
- [ ] Make GetToken and GetUrl one function, since they're always used together anyways
- [ ] Go through the "TODO" comments in the code and resolve them.
- [ ] Easy reply embed functions instead of plain messages

## Done
