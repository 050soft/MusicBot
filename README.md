# MusicBot
name is subject to change once I think of one

I started this project to develop my skills further by challenging myself with some new things and to develop my portfolio. However, feel free to contribute if you wish. Any code help or even tips on what to change are greatly appreciated.    

To run this bot for yourself, rename the .env-example file to just .env, then fill in everything like so
```conf
TOKEN=DISCORD_TOKEN
PUBLIC_KEY=DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY
DISCOGS_CONSUMER_KEY=DISCOGS_CONSUMER_KEY
DISCOGS_CONSUMER_SECRET=DISCOGS_CONSUMER_SECRET
LASTFM_API_KEY=LASTFM_API_KEY
LASTFM_SHARED_SECRET=LASTFM_SHARED_SECRET
```

To get the actual keys, secrets and tokens to run the bot properly you will have to create a Discord bot application, a Last.fm API account and a Discogs API account.
